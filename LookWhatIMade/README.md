# This Page is for you!

*This page hosts the repository of code covered in this [blogpost](http://wp.me/p3Q7Nu-1gX) on FoxDeploy.com.*

Did you create something cool?  If so, fork this, add a screen shot (Or code samples!) this this folder and then send a Pull Request.  If a bunch of people do this, I'll make a new post highlighting some of the cool stuff people have done!

Some ideas:

* Figure out how animation works and add it
* Add a progress bar or a 'check now' button
* Add a countdown until the next request time
