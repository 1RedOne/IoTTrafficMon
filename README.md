This page hosts the repository of code covered in this [blogpost](http://wp.me/p3Q7Nu-1gX) on FoxDeploy.com.

You are free to use and modify this code in any way, and I hope you do!  If you create a cool monitoring anything, please share examples or screenshots of what you created in the .\LookWhatIMade folder!

The .\WIP folder contains a Point-in-time example of the code, referenced in the post as well.
